An interdisciplinary studio based in Portland.

We design and build interactive experiences for clients and partners that share our commitment to knowledge and opportunity.

…

Typically, we take on projects that involve a combination of:

- Strategy
- Information architecture
- User experience & interface design
- Visual design
- Front- and back-end web development

…

Most recently, we designed and developed the website and online shop for <a href="https://upperleftroasters.com/" target="_blank">Upper Left Roasters</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://thepressure.org/" target="_blank">The Pressure</a>. We were asked to translate the existing brand and aesthetic to the web, drawing inspiration from their beautiful café and roastery in Southeast Portland.

Mercy Corps asked us to develop a flexible identity system and UI style guide for <a href="http://toladata.com/" target="_blank">Tola</a>, their new suite of project health monitoring web applications.

We also built a prototype for Mercy Corps’ <a href="http://mercycorps.github.io/InvestMap/" target="_blank">INVEST project</a> that combines data-visualization and narrative in a novel map-based interface.

We have an ongoing relationship with <a href="https://scripted.org/" target="_blank">ScriptEd</a>, a New York-based non-profit that makes technology education available to underserved high school students. Originally, we built their website, but have since extended its functionality and produced related materials as they've grown, exponentially.

For the last year, we've also partnered with <a href="http://spokebranding.com/" target="_blank">Spoke</a> to help estimate, pitch and develop for a handful of web projects.
