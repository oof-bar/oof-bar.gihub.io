An interdisciplinary studio based in Portland.

We design and build interactive experiences for clients and partners that share our committment to knowledge and opportunity.

…

Typically, we take on projects that involve a combination of:

- Strategy
- Information architecture
- User experience & interface design
- Visual design
- Front- and back-end web development

…

Most recently, we developed a flexible identity system for [Tola](http://toladata.com/), a new suite of project health monitoring web applications built by Mercy Corps. We later extended the brand by creating a comprehensive UI styleguide.

We also built a prototype for Mercy Corps’ [INVEST project](http://mercycorps.github.io/InvestMap/) that combines data-visualization and narrative in a novel map-based interface.

[Upper Left Roasters](https://upperleftroasters.com/)' website and online shop was a collaboration with [The Pressure](http://thepressure.org/). We were asked to translate the existing brand and aesthetic to the web, drawing inspiration from their beautiful café and roastery in Southeast Portland.

We have an ongoing relationship with [ScriptEd](https://scripted.org/), a New York-based non-profit that makes technology education available to underserved high school students. Originally, we built their website, but have since extended its functionality and produced countless related materials as they've grown, exponentially.

For the last year, we've also partnered with [Spoke](http://spokebranding.com/) to help estimate, pitch and develop for a handful of web projects.
