An interdisciplinary studio based in Portland.

We design and build interactive experiences for clients and partners that share our commitment to knowledge and opportunity.

…

Typically, we take on projects that involve a combination of:

- Strategy
- Information architecture
- User experience & interface design
- Visual design
- Front- and back-end web development

…

In June, we launched the <a href="https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/" target="_blank">Coffee Variety Catalog</a> in partnership with World Coffee Research, bringing farmers in Mesoamerica and the Carribbean in closer contact with cutting edge genetics research.

Last Summer, we designed and developed the website and online shop for <a href="https://upperleftroasters.com/" target="_blank">Upper Left Roasters</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://thepressure.org/" target="_blank">The Pressure</a>.

Winter of 2015, we built a prototype for Mercy Corps’ <a href="http://mercycorps.github.io/InvestMap/" target="_blank">INVEST project</a> that combines data-visualization and narrative in a novel map-based interface.

We have an ongoing relationship with <a href="https://scripted.org/" target="_blank">ScriptEd</a>, a New York-based non-profit that makes technology education available to underserved high school students. Originally, we built their website, but have since extended its functionality and produced related materials as they've grown, exponentially.

For the last year, we've also partnered with <a href="http://spokebranding.com/" target="_blank">Spoke</a> to help estimate, pitch and develop for a handful of web projects.
